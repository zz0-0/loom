## Conclusion

Loom has a strong architectural foundation and some well-implemented features, particularly in workspace management and settings. However, it lacks the core text editing functionality that defines a document editor. The implementation roadmap provides a clear path to transform Loom from a file manager into a fully-featured document editor with Blox language support.

The project's Clean Architecture and extensible design make it well-positioned for future enhancements, but immediate focus should be on implementing the missing core editing features to create a minimum viable product.</content>
