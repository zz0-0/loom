## Conclusion

Loom has a solid architectural foundation and several well-implemented features, particularly in workspace management, file operations, and basic text editing with syntax highlighting. However, it lacks many advanced editor features that would make it a fully-featured document editor.

**Current Strengths:**
- Clean Architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Working file explorer and workspace management
- Blox language support with Rust backend
- Syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- Modern UI with Material 3 design
- Find/replace functionality
- **Undo/Redo system with keyboard shortcuts**
- **Clipboard operations (copy/cut/paste)**
- **Code Folding with visual controls and shortcuts**
- **Tab indentation and Shift+Tab dedent**
- **Global Search with regex support and workspace-wide search**

**Critical Gaps:**
- **Code Folding**: ✅ Implemented with fold/unfold controls, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+[/]), and visual indicators
- Low test coverage
- No CI/CD pipeline
- **Export functionality**: ✅ Implemented with multiple format support

The project's Clean Architecture and extensible design make it well-positioned for future enhancements, but immediate focus should be on implementing the missing core editing features (undo/redo, clipboard operations, advanced shortcuts) to create a minimum viable product that functions as a proper text editor.

**Next Priority Actions:**
1. ✅ Implement undo/redo system
2. ✅ Add clipboard operations (copy/paste)
3. ✅ Expand keyboard shortcuts
4. ✅ Implement code folding
5. ✅ Implement Tab indentation (Shift+Tab dedent)
6. ✅ Implement Global Search with regex support
7. ✅ Implement export functionality
8. Increase test coverage
9. Add CI/CD pipeline</content>
