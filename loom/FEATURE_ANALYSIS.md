## Conclusion

Loom has a solid architectural foundation and several well-implemented features, particularly in workspace management, file operations, and basic text editing with syntax highlighting. However, it lacks many advanced editor features that would make it a fully-featured document editor.

**Current Strengths:**
- Clean Architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Working file explorer and workspace management
- Blox language support with Rust backend
- Enhanced syntax highlighting for multiple languages with Blox support
- Modern UI with Material 3 design
- Advanced find/replace functionality with regex and file modification
- **Undo/Redo system with keyboard shortcuts**
- **Clipboard operations (copy/cut/paste)**
- **Enhanced Code Folding with multi-language support**
- **Tab indentation and Shift+Tab dedent**
- **Global Search with regex support, case-sensitive matching, and replace functionality**
- **Minimap for large files with scroll synchronization**
- **Centralized AppAnimations system for consistent micro-interactions**

**Critical Gaps:**
- **Code Folding**: ✅ Implemented with fold/unfold controls, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+[/]), and visual indicators
- Low test coverage
- No CI/CD pipeline
- **Export functionality**: ✅ Implemented with multiple format support

The project's Clean Architecture and extensible design make it well-positioned for future enhancements, but immediate focus should be on implementing the missing core editing features (undo/redo, clipboard operations, advanced shortcuts) to create a minimum viable product that functions as a proper text editor.

**Next Priority Actions:**
1. ✅ Implement undo/redo system
2. ✅ Add clipboard operations (copy/paste)
3. ✅ Expand keyboard shortcuts
4. ✅ Implement enhanced code folding with multi-language support
5. ✅ Implement Tab indentation (Shift+Tab dedent)
6. ✅ Implement enhanced Global Search with regex and replace functionality
7. ✅ Implement export functionality
8. ✅ Enhance syntax highlighting with Blox support
9. ✅ Implement minimap for large files
10. ✅ Implement centralized AppAnimations system
11. Increase test coverage
12. Add CI/CD pipeline</content>
